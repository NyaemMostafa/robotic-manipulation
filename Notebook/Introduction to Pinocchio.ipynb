    "# Quick introduction to Pinocchio (for kinematics)\n",
    "This notebook is a quick introduction to [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), a very convenient library for robot kinematics and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinocchio is a great library to compute kinematics and dynamics information of a robot. It is often used in algorithms, for example:\n",
    "* to build a simulator (Pinocchio can deal with the kinematics and dynamics part of the simulation)\n",
    "* in optimal control algorithms to help compute the robot dynamics and its derivatives\n",
    "* in any algorithm that needs access to robot information (kinematics or dynamics)\n",
    "* It also implements homogeneous transforms and all the associated algebra, quaternions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Meshcat to display the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the robots are described by a URDF file (which describes their kinematic tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirement\n",
    "To run these examples you will need to install these two packages:\n",
    "* [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), you can install it directly through conda `conda install pinocchio -c conda-forge` or follow the [installation instructions](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html#Install_3)\n",
    "* [Meshcat](https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat-python) which is used for the visualization of the robot. You can install it directly through pip `pip install meshcat`"
