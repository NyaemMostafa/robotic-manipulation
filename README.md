# ROB2004 Robotics Manipulation and Locomotion

This repository provides material used for the class **ROB2004 Robotic manipulation and locomotion** taught at New York University by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti). You are free to use and copy this material (at your own risk), please reference the material if you use it.
## Prerequisites
We work with Python 3.8 using numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Mujoco, and Pinocchio. Most the material will be given as Jupyter notebooks. The project comes with Docker and Devcontainers support for automatic installation on Ubuntu machines but can also be installed manually as explained [here](docs/Installation.md).
 
The class assumes basic familiarity with Python. The web is full of great tutorials in case a you need to learn this language and libraries used in this class. For example:

- For Python you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NakyjvSrTIQ&list=PLKYEe2WisBTFEr6laH5bR2J19j7sl5O8R&index=2).

- To learn Numpy for people coming from Matlab [this](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html) is recommended. You can also find numerous Tutorials on Youtube like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI).

- Plotting with Python using Matplotlib is needed for this class. You can use [this](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4) to learn about it. 

- (Optional): To learn about the Mujoco simulator used in this class you can read the very nice documentation [here](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html).
