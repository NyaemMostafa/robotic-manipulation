# Laboratory 2: Forward Kinematics

Welcome to the second laboratory of the semester. 

## Goals
The goals of the laboratory are
1. to get a better grasp of homogeneous transforms and how we can use them with our robots
2. learn how to build complex rigid transforms from simple building blocks
3. implement your first forward kinematics algorithm
4. use the forward kinematics algorithm to analyze the movements of the robot's end-effector


## Pre-requisites
Most of the lab can be done on your personal computer (except the real-robot part). All the required software is installed on the lab computers but to do the lab on your machine, you will need to have installed on your machine:
* Python 3 (e.g. using Anaconda)
* numpy, matplotlib (comes by default with Anaconda)

## Instructions
Complete the [Forward Kinematics notebook](Forward_Kinematics.ipynb)
